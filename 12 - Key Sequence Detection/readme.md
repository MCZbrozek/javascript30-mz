### Key Sequencing detection

This exercise tracked the 'keyup' event, logged the keys in an
array called 'pressed'. We then applied the splice prototype to the array to 
truncate the array down to the length of our 'secretCode' = mikez.

We then used an if statement to see if pressed.join includes the secret code. 
if so, then run cornify.js. Which added beautiful unicorns and rainbows to our blank
page.
